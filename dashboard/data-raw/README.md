Process dashboard data
======================

Take the forecasts and DV data and turn them into specific data forms that the dashboard needs. Pre-process to avoid unneccessary calculations in the dashboard.

- `country_characteristics_dat_signature.yml` and `map_dat_sample.csv` are trackers for git diff, so it's easier to spot any substantive differences (that may indicate unintentioned errors)
