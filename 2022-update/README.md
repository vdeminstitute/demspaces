This folder contains documentation related to the spring 2022 forecast update. 

Update report:

- [Democratic Spaces 2022](democratic-spaces-2022.pdf)

Major changes are documented in [NEWS.md](../NEWS.md)

Notes you can find here:

- [France case investigation (whatif-france.md)](whatif-france.md): Why does France have a high risk for Associational closing?
- [RF Stability (rf-stability.md)](rf-stability.md): What is the impact of the number of trees in a forest on the variability of point forecasts? In other words, how many trees buy you a sufficient reduction in the "randomness" of random forests?
- [Tuning experiments (tuning-experiments.md)](tuning-experiments.md): Tuning experiments to determine the fixed hyperparameters that are now used in all models.
- [Variable importance for the standard deviation variable transforms](vi-sdvars.md): Instead of "_squared" terms, I added "_sd10"--10-year moving standard deviations--to the models this year. This was based on a comparison of 5-, 10-, and 20-year moving SDs.
