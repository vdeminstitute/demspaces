2021 Update Data
================

I went through three iterations for the 2021 forecast update, denoted with the "abc" version tags.

- v11a: initial update using the same predictors as v9 and v10 of DemSpaces had
- v11b: reduced the number of predictors by almost half, using the variable importance investigation
- v11c: re-run of the forecasts using the V-Dem version 11.1 fix that came out at the end of March. This changed a few transitions related to the horizontal and vertical accountability indices.
