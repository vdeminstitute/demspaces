2021 Update (v3)
================

- Variable importance investigation. 

### Add versioning system. 

For the 2021 update, I (AB) added an explicit versioning for key files that matches the version of the V-Dem data used in that year's forecasts. 

- Key files--the `states` merge data and the actual forecasts--now include a version suffix in the filename. 
- Copies of the key files and associated summary statistics are now preserved in the `archive/` folder. I moved the 2019 and 2020 forecasts from `forecasts/` to the archive folder. 


2020 Update (v2)
================

- Data range from 1970 to 2019.
- Added Archigos state leader data as a data source, with 5 variables.

2019 initial version (v1)
